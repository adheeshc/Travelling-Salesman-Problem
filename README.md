# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Implemented Kruskal and Prim's Algorithm by constructing MST for TSP problem 

=================================
FILE DESCRIPTIONS
=================================
1) CODE folder/init.py - tour length only (optimized)
2) CODE folder/test.py - MST only (unstable)
3) FINAL Folder - contains the 3 output files for eil51.tsp,eil76.tsp,eil101.tsp
4) VIDEOS Folder - contains videos of code running
5) INPUT Folder - contains 3 input files
6) Report - final report 

=================================
Libraries Used
=================================
1) Numpy 
2) matplotlib
3) math
4) itertools
5) datetime

=================================
RUN INSTRUCTION
=================================

"BEFORE RUNNING ANY CODES, PLEASE ENSURE THEY ARE NOT ENABLED TO OVERWRITE EXISTING OUTPUT FILES"

1) Make sure the input files are all in the same folder as the code
2) Make sure all the libraries are installed
3) RUN init.py to run the code for tour length(optimized)
4) RUN test.py to run the code for MST(unstable)

Please note since test.py is done using 'combinations' from itertools, the number of vertices cannot be too high else the time complexity increases exponentially.
